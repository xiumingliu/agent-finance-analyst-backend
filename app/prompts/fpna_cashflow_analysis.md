# FP&A Business Knowledge — Cash Flow & Operational Analysis

## Cash Flow (Indirect)
- Typical structure:
  - Start from Net Income.
  - Adjust for non-cash items (depreciation/amortization, FX revaluation).
  - Working capital changes: ΔAR, ΔAP, ΔInventory, ΔOther current assets/liabilities.
  - Investing cash flows: CAPEX (additions to tangible/intangible assets), acquisitions/disposals.
  - Financing cash flows: new debt/equity, repayments, dividends, lease payments (IFRS 16).
- If only journal lines exist:
  - Infer working capital by account mapping:
    - AR: customer receivables accounts.
    - AP: vendor payables accounts.
    - Inventory: inventory accounts and COGS contra entries.
  - CAPEX: accounts tagged as fixed assets additions.
  - Financing: loan principal accounts, equity movements, dividends.

## Practical Analyses
- Collections risk: AR aging (0–30/31–60/61–90/>90 days), top 10 overdue customers.
- Payables management: AP aging, early/late payment patterns, supplier concentration.
- Cash conversion cycle: DSO, DPO, DIO then CCC = DSO + DIO − DPO.
- Seasonality: monthly/weekly cash in/out trends; compare YoY.
- Scenarioing: simulate “what if” for AR payment terms (+7 days), inventory turns ±10%, etc.

## Output Expectations
- For each analysis:
  - 1–2 sentence executive takeaway.
  - The key metric table or chart (using the plotting rules).
  - A short “actions” list (e.g., “tighten terms for top 5 overdue customers”).
- If account mappings are unknown, propose a sensible default mapping and explain the mapping.
